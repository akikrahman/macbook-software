# macbook-software
A bash script to install tools used by DTS Developers &amp; A&amp;P Data Engineers

Open a terminal â€“ The Mac terminal seems to be almost identical to a Linux Bash Shell.  Like using WSL on Windows.

Create a folder for this, I created /Projects/macbook-software
Open terminal
% mkdir Projects/macbook-software
% cd Projects/macbook-software
% git init
% git clone https://github.com/hmcts/macbook-software
# to download the files
% chmod +x setup.sh 
# to make it executable
% ./setup.sh
# to run the script

As the script runs it will prompt several times for admin password to proceed with an install.  The admin password is the one you use to login to the Macbook, not your AppleId password.
